# Instructions for exploiting vulnerabilities in the MoneyX app

## Exploits

### Malicious Payload (Intrusion Prevention)
Open a terminal window and paste in the following (ShellShock) exploit:
```
curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/eject" http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
Note: The application doesn't actually suffer from the ShellShock vulnerability.  But, Cloud One Application Security's Malicious Payload algorithms will pick up on the attempts.

### SQL Injection

Note: Before you begin, be sure to enable the various algorithms within the SQL Injection Policy Configuration!!

To trigger a SQL Injection, do this:

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/

2. Login to the application
```
user / user123
```
3. In the menu bar, click "Payments" > "Received Payments".

Note that there are no received payments visible for your user id (which is '3')

4. In the URL bar, append the following and hit Enter: ' or 1=1'

After appending, the URL should look like this:  http://127.0.0.1:8080/payment/list-received/3 or 1=1

If the attack is successful, you should now see received payments (that pertain to other users of the system).
